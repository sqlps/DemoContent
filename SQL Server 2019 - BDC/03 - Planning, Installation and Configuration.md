<i>NOTE: The following Module is based on the Private Preview of the Microsoft SQL Server 2019 big data cluster feature. These instructions will change as the product is updated for the final release. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/big-data-cluster/deployment-guidance?view=sqlallproducts-allversions" target="_blank">The latest installation instructions are located here</a>.</i>

A SQL Server big data cluster (BDC) is deployed onto a Kubernetes Cluster using the `mssqlctl` utility which creates the appropriate Docker Containers and other constructs for the system. The installation uses various switches on the `mssqlctl` utility, and reads from several environment variables which you will define before you run the command. Note that these environment variables will be replaced with a different system at General Availability (GA) release. 

For planning, it is essential that you understand the SQL Server BDC components, and have a firm understanding of Kubernetes and TCP/IP networking. You should also have an understanding of how SQL Server and Apache Spark use the "Big Four"  (*CPU, I/O, Memory and Networking*). 

Since the Kubernetes Cluster is often made up of Virtual Machines that host the Docker Images, they must be as large as possible. For the best possible performance, large physical machines that are tuned for optimal performance is a recommended physical architecture. The least viable production system is a Minimum of 3 Linux physical machines or virtual machines. The recommended configuration per machine is 8 CPUs, 32 GB of memory and 100GB of storage. This configuration would support only one or two users with a standard workload, and you would want to increase the system for each additional user or heavier workload. 


You can deploy Kubernetes in three general ways:
 - In a Cloud Platform such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

 - In your own Kubernetes deployment using KubeADM

 - In your own Kubernetes deployment using minikube (*to be used only for training and testing*)

Regardless of the Kubernetes target, the general steps for setting up the system are:

 - Set up Kubernetes cluster

 - Install the cluster configuration tool `mssqlctl` on the administration machine

 - Deploy the SQL Server big data cluster onto the Kubernetes cluster

In the sections that follow, you'll cover the general process for each of these deployments. The official documentation referenced above have the specific steps for each deployment, and the Activity section of this Module has the steps for deploying the BDC on AKS for the classroom enviornment.

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png"><a name="3-1">3.1 Installing on Azure Kubernetes Service</a></h2>

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads" target="_blank">Azure Kubernetes Service</a> provides the ability to create a Kubernetes cluster in the Azure portal, with the Azure CLI, or template driven deployment options such as Resource Manager templates and Terraform. When you deploy an AKS cluster, the Kubernetes master and all nodes are deployed and configured for you. Additional features such as advanced networking, Azure Active Directory integration, and monitoring can also be configured during the deployment process.

An AKS cluster is divided into two components: The *Cluster master nodes* which provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads; and the *Nodes* which run your application workloads.

<br>

The cluster master includes the following core Kubernetes components:

 - *kube-apiserver* - The API server is how the underlying Kubernetes APIs are exposed. This component provides the interaction for management tools, such as kubectl or the Kubernetes dashboard.

 - *etcd* - To maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration, the highly available etcd is a key value store within Kubernetes.

 - *kube-scheduler* - When you create or scale applications, the Scheduler determines what nodes can run the workload and starts them.

 - *kube-controller-manager* - The Controller Manager oversees a number of smaller Controllers that perform actions such as replicating pods and handling node operations.

The Nodes include the following components: 

 - The *kubelet* is the Kubernetes agent that processes the orchestration requests from the cluster master and scheduling of running the requested containers.

 - Virtual networking is handled by the *kube-proxy* on each node. The proxy routes network traffic and manages IP addressing for services and pods.

 - The *container runtime* is the component that allows containerized applications to run and interact with additional resources such as the virtual network and storage. In AKS, Docker is used as the container runtime.

For a SQL Server BDC in an AKS environment, for an optimal experience while validating basic scenarios, you should use at least three agent VMs with at least 4 vCPUs and 32 GB of memory each.

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png"><a name="3-2">3.2 Installing Locally Using KubeADM</h2>

The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/" target="_blank">kubeadm toolbox</a> helps you bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. Kubeadm also supports other cluster lifecycle functions, such as upgrades, downgrade, and managing bootstrap tokens.

The kubeadm toolbox can deploy a Kubernetes cluster to physical or virtual machines. It works by specifying the TCP/IP addresses of the targets.

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png"><a name="3-3">3.3 Installing Locally Using minikube</a></h2>

Minikube is a tool that simplifies creating and running Kubernetes locally. Minikube creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. It uses Hyper-V, VirtualBox, or other Hypervisor products to create and operate the cluster. 

While SQL Server BDC can be installed on minikube, it requires at least 32GB of RAM to run, and really needs 64GB of RAM or more to perform any real testing. In any case, it is reserved only for testing or training.

Minikube supports the following Kubernetes features:

 - DNS
 - NodePorts
 - ConfigMaps and Secrets
 - Dashboards
 - Container Runtime: Docker, rkt, CRI-O and containerd
 - Enabling CNI (Container Network Interface)
 - Data Ingress

In this lab you will check your deployment you performed in Module 01 of a SQL Server 2019 big data cluster on the Azure Kubernetes Service. 

Using the following steps, you will evaluate your Resource Group in Azure that holds your BDC on AKS that you deployed earlier. When you complete your course you can delete this Resource Group which will stop the Azure charges for this course.
