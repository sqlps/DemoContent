-- Demonstrate Operational Analytics Performance.
--   This script can be run while the Order Insert workload driver is running.
--   A larger amount of data results in a bigger performance gain from using nonclustered columnstore.
--   Therefore, it is best to run the Order Insert workload for a while (at least 20 minutes, making sure 
--   to have enough rows, and making sure compression kicks in) before compare the performance.
-- The script runs the query with and without nonclustered columnstore index (the technology used for
--   operational analytics), and outputs the time taken in the messages pane.

-- During the working day, Wide World Importers processes orders from customers. It is important
-- to estimate if stock will run out soon. To avoid this, a stock burn down rate needs to be 
-- calculated. The first part of this is to work out quantities on order lines that have not
-- yet been picked.
-- Terry, an analyst with the company has written a query that assesses the rate at which
-- the stock is being sold, and estimates (based on the sales rate), when the excess stock will
-- be sold. The problem with this query is that it uses the same tables that are being used by
-- the core order processing function within the company, and can impact the performance of those
-- tables if the query is run frequently. 

-- Terry has heard that SQL Server 2016 has strengths in operational analytics and hopes that
-- these capabilbies can allow him to run his queries even during busy order processing periods.


-- The above procedure creates nonclustered columnstore indexes on the Sales.OrderLines and Sales.InvoiceLines 
-- tables. Take a moment to view them now using Object Explorer.

-- The following query can be used to sum the stock yet to be picked for all stock items.
