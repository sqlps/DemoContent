Row Level Security (RLS)

Login to the application

Sign in using (Rachel@contoso.com/Password1!) or (alice@contoso.com/Password1!)

Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
•Connect to your database using SSMS: Instructions
•Open Enable-RLS.sql (Find it here: C:\Users\dpless\Desktop\DEMOS\0. Solution\sql-server-samples-master\samples\features\security\contoso-clinic\tsql-scripts)
•Execute the commands 
•Observe the changes to the results returned on the /visits or /patients page

How did that work?

The application leverages an Entity Framework feature called interceptors

Specifically, we used a  DbConnectionInterceptor . The  Opened()  function is called whenever Entity Framework opens a connection and we set SESSION_CONTEXT with the current application  UserId  there. 

Predicate functions

The predicate functions we created in Enable-RLS.sql identify users by the  UserId  which was set by our interceptor whenever a connection is established from the application. The two types of predicates we created were Filter and Block. 
•Filter predicates silently filter  SELECT ,  UPDATE , and  DELETE  operations to exclude rows that do not satisfy the predicate. 
•Block predicates explicitly block (throw errors) on  INSERT ,  UPDATE , and  DELETE  operations that do not satisfy the predicate.
